            <h5>React mainly works on two packages which is React and React DOM. When we type any code in functional component or class based component, that remain as a pure javascript code. Pure JavaScript code converted into HTML by React package, which uses Babel Compiler.Because what we see on a webpage is HTML.Then React DOM package injects that converted code into index.html. That's how React works.</h5>
